Does string variable contain null pointer?
Ans: No, but you can add null pointer like any other variable
sting s;
s[i] = '\0';

No, but if you say temp.c_str() a null terminator will be included in the return from this method.

It's also worth saying that you can include a null character in a string just like any other character.

string s("hello");
cout << s.size() << ' ';
s[1] = '\0';
cout << s.size() << '\n';
prints

5 5

and not 5 1 as you might expect if null characters had a special meaning for strings.
